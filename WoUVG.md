# World of Ultraviolet

This is the first playtest document for World of Ultraviolet. 

## Principles

- **This is not a complete game.** You still need the Ultraviolet Grasslands book for this to work, and you should support Luka Rejec when you get it.
- Everything you do and decide should reflect the psychedelic trippy wonder of the world. Paint with colors you see only in your dreams. Like all other settings, the true Ultraviolet Grasslands gets discovered at the table rather than in a book or a document. 
- Use lots of random tables. Don’t write plots. Players should be creative in figuring out how to deal with situations. 
- Balance and “rules as written” are false gods. Tune the game to keep it fun for all the players. 
- The GM is a player too.
- Your group might come up with more stuff not reflected here. Maybe your game will include specific conditions, or fatigue, or more magic. If you do, write it up and post it somewhere so other people can riff on it.

## Rules Summary
### Character Creation

If you don’t know who your character is, roll on UVG p. 7 or just look at the list for ideas. Take an interesting little trinket that reflects your background or interests.

**Skills** reflect things you know. They are learned, not innate, and developing new ones will require time and effort. **Choose two skills from the list below.** This list is not comprehensive; if desired, talk with the other players about making up new ones. When you use a skill, you always accomplish your task. That doesn’t necessarily mean good news though.

1. Acrobatics
2. Animals
3. Archaeology
4. Assassination
5. Biomechanics
6. Capitalism
7. Chemistry
8. Construction
9. Crystal Healing
10. Driving
11. Entertainment
12. Farming
13. Fishing
14. Foraging
15. Hunting
16. Magitech
17. Medicine
18. Narcotics
19. Packing
20. Protocol
21. Smuggling
22. Spelunking
23. Surgery
24. Tinkering

**Talents** are natural abilities you can do innately. **Choose one talent from the list below.** You and your group might make up others. Good talents let you do something different, not just add another number. As you gain experience, you may unlock other talents.

1. **Agile:** Worn armor counts as one type lighter for speed purposes
2. **Booksmart:** Once per week, you know some pertinent fact that helps tremendously
3. **Charismatic:** Once per week, you can get somebody to do something they might not have
4. **Eldritch:** Once per week, you can attempt to change reality in some subtle way
5. **Lethal:** Advantage on rolling melee damage
6. **Lucky:** Once per week, turn a miss into a partial success
7. **Reflexes:** You always go first and can react when suddenly surprised
8. **Resilient:** You use a d8 for your Hit Dice
9. **Sharp-Eyed:** When scouting, you always spot the target before they spot you
10. **Stealthy:** Advantage when attempting to evade detection
11. **Tough:** Enemies have disadvantage when rolling damage against you
12. **Volley:** Advantage on rolling ranged damage

**The wilderness will change you.** Discoveries such as ancient ruins, magitech artifacts, extradimensional projection, and the like may bestow abilities (potentially beyond those listed) or alter your form. Explore the world, make interesting choices, and see what happens.

## Rolling the Dice

**When you attempt something risky,** tell the GM what you’re trying to do and how, including any applicable attributes, skills, or items. The GM will tell you what you could potentially achieve and how badly things could go. You can decide whether you want to take the risk or do something else. If you do, roll 2d6:

- **A roll of 12 or more is the best news:** you do it perfectly and get some extra benefit or advantage.
- **A roll of 10 or more is good news:** you do it as well as could be expected without any complications.
- **A roll of 7-9 is mixed news:** you do it, more or less, but something else happens, like a complication, extra cost, harm, etc.
- **A roll of 6- is bad news:** it doesn’t go well and things get worse.

**If you have an applicable skill,** even on a 6-, you still do it, but bad things (worse than a mixed result) will happen regardless.

## Luck Dice

**Sometimes the GM will roll a luck die to see how the situation is established.** On a 1, it’s bad for you. On a 2-3, you have some indication that things could go wrong. On a 4-6, it’s fine for now. The GM might choose to roll more than one die and take the highest or lowest in certain circumstances.

## Hit Dice

You start with 1 Hit Die (d6) and gain more as you level. You can add another if you are attended by a qualified healer, and another if you are resting in a safe, civilized settlement.  The GM may grant an additional HD in some circumstances. When you rest and have food and clean water available, re-roll all your HD and keep a number equal to your level as your HP.

## Equipment

You start with €100. You can start with more (up to €1000) but you will be in debt to somebody. 

### Weapons

The GM may create other weapons that don’t fall precisely into these categories or have special properties. See UVG pp. 172-173 for more examples. 

- **Light weapons** (€10): d6 damage. Includes daggers, short swords, hand axes, small bows, slings, etc. One stone.
- **Military weapons** (€40): d8 damage. Includes long swords, axes, light crossbows, lances, etc. Two stones.
- **Great weapons** (€100): d10 damage. Includes great swords, battle axes, heavy crossbows, etc. Two stones.

### Armor

Roll the indicated die to reduce incoming damage. The GM might compare your speed to the opponents, making situations more or less risky if appropriate. Other armor with special properties exists, but it isn’t cheap and might not even be available for sale.

- **Light armor** (€10): d2. Leather, thick cloth, etc. Normal speed. One stone.
- **Medium armor** (€50): d4. Light metal or other resistant materials. Slow speed. Two stones.
- **Heavy armor** (€1000): d6. Technological marvel of protection. Very slow speed. Three stones.

Magitech isn’t available for sale, at least not in most places. You need to find it in the wilderness or otherwise track it down from the rare folks who might be willing to part with it for mundane cash. It might still have other costs associated with it that go beyond material goods, regardless of how you acquire it.

### Other gear and transportation

- See p. 170-171 for basic supplies, tools, and transportation. 
- Use the Inventory rules from p. 149 and the Caravan rules from p. 156.

## Experience

Gain experience as per whatever your group decides. See p. 146-147 for details. New abilities gained via experience should reflect what you’re already doing (or trying to do). Other abilities come from the specifics of your adventure and don’t come from these points.

| Level | Hit Dice | Abilities | XP Total |
| ----- | -------- | --------- | -------- |
| 1     | 1        | 1         | 0        |
| 2     | +1       |           | 1000     |
| 3     |          |           | 2500     |
| 4     |          | +1        | 5000     |
| 5     | +1       |           | 8000     |
| 6     |          |           | 12000    |
| 7     |          | +1        | 18000    |
| 8     | +1       |           | 25000    |
| 9     |          |           | 35000    |
| 10    |          | +1        | 50000    |



That XP total column is a subjective curve and you shouldn’t assume it has any mathematical precision. If the group or a player just finished something really cool and they are close to the next level, give it to them. If you think the numbers are too harsh or too generous, tweak them.
