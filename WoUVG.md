# World of Ultraviolet v0.1
This is the first playtest document for World of Ultraviolet. 

## Principles
- **This is not a complete game.** You still need the Ultraviolet Grasslands book for this to work, and you should support Luka Rejec when you get it.
- Everything you do and decide should reflect the psychedelic trippy wonder of the world. Paint with colors you see only in your dreams. Like all other settings, the true Ultraviolet Grasslands gets discovered at the table rather than in a book or a document. 
- Use lots of random tables. Don’t write plots. Players should be creative in figuring out how to deal with situations. 
- Balance and “rules as written” are false gods. Tune the game to keep it fun for all the players. 
- The GM is a player too.
- Your group might come up with more stuff not reflected here. Maybe your game will include specific conditions, or fatigue, or more magic. If you do, write it up and post it somewhere so other people can riff on it.

## Rules Summary
### Character Creation

If you don’t know who your character is, roll on UVG p. 7 or just look at the list for ideas. Take an interesting little trinket that reflects your background or interests.

### Attributes
Choose one of the following:

- **Standard array:** Assign the following values as you see fit: +2, +1, +1, 0, 0, 0
- **Random generation:** Roll 2d6 for each. On a 6-, the value is 0. On a 7-9, the value is +1. On a 10 or 11, the value is +2. On a 12, the value is +3.

### Skills
Choose two skills from the list below or make others up (talk to the GM and your group first). When you use a skill, you always accomplish your task. That doesn’t always mean good things though.

- Acrobatics
- Animals
- Archaeology
- Biomechanics
- Capitalism
- Chemistry
- Construction
- Crystal Healing
- Driving
- Entertainment
- Farming
- Fishing
- Foraging
- Hunting
- Magitech
- Medicine
- Narcotics
- Packing
- Protocol
- Smuggling
- Spelunking
- Surgery

### Abilities
Choose one from the list or make another one up. Good abilities let you do something different, not just add another number.

- **Backstab:** Roll max damage when attacking from concealment
- **Booksmart:** Once per week, you know some pertinent fact that helps tremendously
- **Hardy:** Roll and keep an extra Hit Die whenever determining HP
- **Lucky:** Once per week turn a miss into a partial success
- **Pet:** You have a loyal and effective animal companion
- **Reflexes:** You always go first and can react when suddenly surprised
- **Scout:** When scouting, you always spot the target before they spot you
- **Skirmish:** Worn armor counts as one type lighter for speed purposes
- **Slay:** Advantage on rolling melee damage
- **Tinker:** You have advantage when working on small mechanisms
- **Tough:** Enemies have disadvantage when rolling damage against you
- **Volley:** Advantage on rolling ranged damage

Other less mundane abilities may be discovered in ancient ruins, magitech artifacts, astral projection, and the like.

## Rolling the Dice

**When you attempt something risky,** roll 2d6 and add one of your attribute scores, based on the action you're taking. The GM will discuss potential outcomes with you before you roll, including how well things could go and how badly. You can decide whether you want to take the risk or do something else. 


- **A roll of 12 or more is the best news:** you do it perfectly and get some extra benefit or advantage.
- **A roll of 10 or more is good news:** you do it without any complications.
- **A roll of 7-9 is mixed news:** you do it, but something else happens, like a complication, extra cost, harm, etc.
- **A roll of 6- is bad news:** it doesn’t go well and something bad happens.

**If you have an applicable skill,** even on a 6-, you still do it, but bad things (worse than a mixed result) will happen regardless.

## Luck Dice

**Sometimes the GM will roll a luck die to see how the situation is established.** On a 1, it’s bad for you. On a 2-3, you have some indication that things could go wrong. On a 4-6, it’s fine for now. The GM might choose to roll more than one die and take the highest or lowest in certain circumstances.

## Equipment

You start with €100. You can start with more (up to €1000) but you will be in debt to somebody. 

### Weapons

The GM may create other weapons that don’t fall precisely into these categories or have special properties. See UVG pp. 172-173 for more examples. 

- **Light weapons** (€10): d6 damage. Includes daggers, short swords, hand axes, small bows, slings, etc. One stone.
- **Military weapons** (€40): d8 damage. Includes long swords, axes, light crossbows, lances, etc. Two stones.
- **Great weapons** (€100): d10 damage. Includes great swords, battle axes, heavy crossbows, etc. Two stones.

### Armor

Roll the indicated die to reduce incoming damage. The GM might compare your speed to the opponents, making situations more or less risky if appropriate. Other armor with special properties exists, but it isn’t cheap and might not even be available for sale.

- **Light armor** (€10): d2. Leather, thick cloth, etc. Normal speed. One stone.
- **Medium armor** (€50): d4. Light metal or other resistant materials. Slow speed. Two stones.
- **Heavy armor** (€1000): d6. Technological marvel of protection. Very slow speed. Three stones.

Magitech isn’t available for sale, at least not in most places. You need to find it in the wilderness or otherwise track it down from the rare folks who might be willing to part with it for mundane cash. It might still have other costs associated with it that go beyond material goods, regardless of how you acquire it.

### Other gear and transportation
- See p. 170-171 for basic supplies, tools, and transportation. 
- Use the Inventory rules from p. 149 and the Caravan rules from p. 156.

## Experience

Gain experience as per whatever your group decides. See p. 146-147 for details. New abilities gained via experience should reflect what you’re already doing (or trying to do). Other abilities come from the specifics of your adventure and don’t come from these points.

| Level | Hit Dice | Attributes | Abilities | XP Total |
| ----- | -------- | ---------- | --------- | -------- |
| 1     | 1+CON    | Starting   | 1         | 0        |
| 2     | +1       |            |           | 1000     |
| 3     |          | +1 (MAX 3) |           | 2500     |
| 4     |          |            | +1        | 5000     |
| 5     | +1       |            |           | 8000     |
| 6     |          | +1 (MAX 3) |           | 12000    |
| 7     |          |            | +1        | 18000    |
| 8     | +1       |            |           | 25000    |
| 9     |          | +1 (MAX 3) |           | 35000    |
| 10    |          |            | +1        | 50000    |

That XP total column is a wild-ass guess and you shouldn’t assume it has tremendous mathematical precision. If the group or a player just finished something really cool and they are close to the next level, give it to them. If you think the numbers are too harsh or too generous, tweak them.
